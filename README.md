## General Information
This README generator is for developers to quickly create a professional README for a new project.  The application will be invoked in the command-line by using the command node index.js.  Once that command is executed, the user will be prompted with a series of questions to respond to.  After the user answers all the questions, a high-quality README will be generated.  The title of the project will be displayed at the top and there will be sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.  The Table of Contents will display as links that will guide to the corresponding section of the README.  The user's responses will be added to the sections with its appropriate title.  As part of the series of questions, the user will choose a license (or none if one wasn't used) and a badge for that license will appear in the README.  When the user enters their GitHub username and email, they will both appear as links under the section entitled Questions.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
